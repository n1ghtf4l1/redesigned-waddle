# **Line Follower Robot Design Simulation on Proteus**

### **What is a Line Follower Robot?**

- Autonomously guided robot that follows a
line drawn on the ground to either detect a
dark line on a white surface or a white line on
a dark surface.

- Self-Correction to stay on track.

- No need of Human Help.

### **Procedure**

- The IR sensor detects the light emitted by the
transmitter, if the receiver receives light, the
wheel of that side will keep on moving, as soon
as the receiver stops receiving the light (black
colour absorbs the light and thus no light is
reflected so receiver cannot receive any light)
the wheel of that side will stop. For turning, the
robot stops 1 motor and runs the second to make
the turn possible.

- For eg: If the robot has to turn right then the
motor on right side will stop and left motor will
keep on running and thus allowing the robot to
turn.
