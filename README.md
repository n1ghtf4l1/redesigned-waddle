# **Line Follower Robot Design Simulation on Proteus**

### **What is a Line Follower Robot?**

- Autonomously guided robot that follows a
line drawn on the ground to either detect a
dark line on a white surface or a white line on
a dark surface.

- Self-Correction to stay on track.

- No need of Human Help.

### **Procedure**

- The IR sensor detects the light emitted by the
transmitter, if the receiver receives light, the
wheel of that side will keep on moving, as soon
as the receiver stops receiving the light (black
colour absorbs the light and thus no light is
reflected so receiver cannot receive any light)
the wheel of that side will stop. For turning, the
robot stops 1 motor and runs the second to make
the turn possible.

- For eg: If the robot has to turn right then the
motor on right side will stop and left motor will
keep on running and thus allowing the robot to
turn.

#### **Algorithm**

- Robot's direction is determined by what the
robot **"sees"**.

- If line is centered in front of robot, go
forward.

- If line is left of center, turn left.

- If line is right of center, turn right.

- If no line is detected, circle until line is found.

### **Applications**

- **Industrial application:** The line followers can be used to
carry/deliver packages in warehouses,airports,restaurants
etc

- **Automobile Industries:** The line follower can also be used
in cars, taxis and buses to create an autonomous transport
system

- **Household application:** It can be used for cleaning and
transport of household items throughout the house

- **Guidance:** It can also be used as guidance for people at
malls, amusement parks and also be of help to physically
challenged people helping them go about their daily lives
as normal people would.
